# Industrial Cybersecurity (Jos Helmich, Konecranes)
Speaker Background: Jos Helmich has 30 years of experience in software engineering and cybersecurity, specializing in product security.

He Mentions his involvement with ENISA (European Union Agency for Cybersecurity) Advisory Group.

He highlights the importance of EU directives and regulations, including the Cybersecurity Act, NIS2, and the Cyber Resilience Act (CRA).

The presentation emphasizes the differences between office (IT) and operational technology (OT) security, noting that in OT, availability is prioritized over confidentiality

The Ideal setup in network architecture in Industrial Settings Includes separate zones: office, DMZ, and industrial zone. There are big Challenges in placing industrial cloud applications within this architecture.

NIS2 focuses on organizational cybersecurity while  CRA emphasizes product cybersecurity.

EU's approach to AI regulation is risk-based, focusing on fundamental freedoms. He mentions various standards and frameworks for AI management and risk assessment.

## Comments and Ideas
-The emphasis on the differences between IT and OT security is crucial for understanding industrial cybersecurity challenges.

-The discussion on AI regulation highlights the growing importance of AI in industrial settings and the need for proper risk management.

-Industrial cybersecurity is evolving, requiring an approach that balances availability, integrity, and comprehensive protection strategies.

## Questions:
-How is the industrial sector preparing for the potential impact of quantum computing on current cybersecurity measures?

-Given the rapid advancement of AI technologies, how frequently should AI risk assessments be conducted in industrial settings?

-What role do international collaborations play in addressing global cybersecurity threats to industrial systems?






# State of Union (Heikki Juva, Traficom)
He discusses cybersecurity regulations, testing, and practical implications for consumer Internet of Things (IoT) devices in the European Union.

#### main regulatory projects:
-Radio Equipment Directive (RED) . This focuses on network security, protection of personal information, and financial assets.

-Cyber Resilience Act (CRA). This addresses technical security and vulnerability coordination.

These regulations are set to be enforced in the coming years, with RED starting in 2025 and CRA following shortly after[

#### Positive Aspects
-Many devices use encrypted communication (90% use TLS)

-Modern encryption protocols are commonly used (TLS 1.3)

-Battery-operated devices often connect only temporarily, enhancing security

#### potential issues with the regulations:
-Loopholes for backwards compatibility

-Ability to outsource security

-Reliance on paper-based evaluations

## Comments and Ideas
-The timeline for implementing new EU regulations suggests that companies need to start preparing now to ensure compliance.

-The potential issues with the regulations, such as loopholes and paper-based evaluations, raise concerns about their effectiveness in practice.

## Questions:
-What impact will these regulations have on innovation and time-to-market for new IoT products?

-How can the gap between paper-based evaluations and real-world security be bridged effectively?
